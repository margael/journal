This week I learned the difference between a content management system system and a static site generator. I had previously heard of Jekyll and I had learned about ed in as my intro to DH course where we talked about minimal computing. This week was the first time I explored the concept. In order to build a static site, I would already have to be able to write my source code for the website, have them saved in a directory in my computer. Then I would run the directory through Jekyll. I would also need to have a NGinx server to be able to launch my website. At this point, I'm still learning the basics of HTML so I'm going to need a lot more practice to attempt to build a static site.
 I also feel the lab we had on Jekyll was the least helpful to me. I don't feel like I know how to run a site generator. I think it will take some experimentation. I would prefer to create a static site over using a CMS since it is the most stable option in terms of longevity of the site and protection from hacking. ALso I think building a static site from scratch would help me develop some many web design skills that I wouldn't necessarily develop using a content management system like Wordpress. This week I also learned about Bootstrap and how its pre-packaged elements can be incorporated in web design to help the developer customize the user experience.
