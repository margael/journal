A web for everyone, what a great concept? Part of being a web developer in the 21st century is to make the web a more inclusive place than it has ever been. I really liked the focus on accessibilty at the core of user experience design. Accessibility should never be an afterthought for a serious web designer. I also like the framing of;

abiliy + barrier = disability

Because when you think about it. Every one is just differently abled, whether physically, intellectually, or psychologically. Barriers in the ways we design structures and services are the reason the are inaccesible to these people. Thank you for sharing this perspective, it really made me rethink my view of disability.

I was thinking of accessibility in python. As an english speaker, python is highly readable to me. You can tell that as a language. it was designed to facilitate human interactions with computers. When you work in python, often time the environment you work in will create the indentation that you need and will highlight certain words in different colors to mark their functions in the code. As as result, you as a user start to identify the rules of the syntax and learn much faster.
