Software Design Lab
Spring 2020

My goal for this course is to learn basic to moderate software design skills to self-reliantly start and finish my own digital projects. I want to learn enough skills to build the bare bones of my own website and applications. I want to achieve moderate proficiency in programming languages such as python and R. I want to achieve fluency in HTML and CSS. I know nothing about SQL so I’m ready to learn more about it.

On a personal level, I’m looking to expand on a wide range of programming skills because I’m currently limited in what I can build. I was able to build my own python notebooks last semester when I completed the methods of text analysis course. Beyond NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib, & NumPy I don’t have enough knowledge of data analysis packages and modules used in computer programming. 

On a professional level, I am completing an internship at the CUNY research foundation on a census evaluation project, one of the biggest data projects ongoing in the world. Although I am a small part of it, I want to be able to continuously bring new skills to the project which is why I’m excited to take this class in tandem. 

So my three goals for the course are:
1.	Moderate proficiency in Python and R.
2.	Basic to moderate software design skills (build static site/ basic app).
3.	Bring one or more new skills to my internship every week.
