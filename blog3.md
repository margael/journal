This week was a harder than the previous weeks in terms of tutorials. Learn Python the Hard Way was a bit difficult for me to manage this week. Although the tutorials were detailed and specific. I was confused as to what I should do. The exercises required python 2. I had already installed python 3 on my computer with Anaconda which has its own powershell. I wasn't sure if I should download python 2 as well since I worry it might create conflicts with python 3 as I've seen it happened to other people in the past. So what I did was follow along with the tutorial. I did download the text editor Atom but I don't know how to use it.

I've used python in the past. I took a programming for everyone class in undergrad where I followed python tutorials  in idle. I can say that I did not learn much from that class because. ALthough I did well at the exercises, I didn't really understand the syntax or what the functions did. Fast forward to last semester, I took a class with Lisa Rhody where we completed python notebooks every week. Often we used nltk, pandas, and numpy packages. It was a text analysis class. I ended up building two python notebooks of my own. I build two corpora on which to run to notebooks. I was very proud of what I accomplished in that class. Now I'm more interested in using python to write programs. And I'm also interested in HTML to build static sites.
