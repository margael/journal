I was really happy to have taken an introduction to command line workshop with Kathryn Mercier last semester. I think it was very helpful in this first week of independent work. I feel a lot more comfortable with using the command line. And I'm even starting to remember the commands without accessing the cheat-sheet. Also when I took the workshop last semester, we did everything on iOS and I did not learn how to transfer those skills to my windows system. So from time to time when I wanted to practice the command line, I would always have to look up commands for windows.
I'm happy to now have git and git bash installed on my computer. It will allow me to use the normal Unix commands and it wwill allow me to explore more with the command line in ways I've never done before. For example, I remember learning briefly about the command grep but never really understood how to use it. This time, I was on my own time playing around with it and eventually figured out how to use it and learned more about the different flags we can use with it. I also practice using redirect and sorting out the contents of a few files.
I had previously completed exercises on how to use git from  datacamp but I did not understand what i was doing very well. I simply learned the command git status, git add, git log, git commit -m "", git push etc. However I did not understand what I was doing until I recently pushed my own files up to github.
So far I have learned a lot but just going through the tutorials. Thank you to the teams who took the time to create these files because they are seriously helping beginners like me gain confidence in using these high level computer skills.
