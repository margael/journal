This Old Lady Shouts at Clouds was exactly what I needed. It was one of the most imformative pieces of text that I've read as a beginner digital humanist. One of the most prohibitive aspects of tech/programming culture is the jargonic/esoteric language that people use to describe everything, even simple things that I would understand if only they were ever said in normalspeak. So I appreciated the directness of the language and equally the deep chrolological knowledge she imparted.

Moving on to HTML. One of the reasons I took this class was to learn HTML and this week made me excited to explore. 
so far with W3Schools HTML is easier than I expected it to be. I spent several hours going through the menu of HTML lessons from the introductory page to HTML and CSS together.
I like how easy HTML taga are to learn. They use very few characters. attributes are also simple. So I'm going to take what I learnt so far and keep practicing.
I think Javascript is another language that I would love to learn but I want to focus on HTML for now since it's so fundamental to web design.
