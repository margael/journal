blog #8

Although we didn't have home work for this week, I wanted to write a blog my python skills. I came into software design lab with a little bit of python skills. At the beginning, I thought i thought my python skills were negligible where the scope of this class is concerned but now i think it was useful that have had that experience using python. I have been created my little file.py and running them in git bash using the for loop arguments. I've also imported libraries such as pandas to creatr small dataframes that I wanted to use. However I'm struggling with the import requests. For whatever reason I'm not able to get into the file.I can do those things in my anaconda environment but I cannot do them in git bash. recently I've done it in Idle but before I couldn't. I'm not sure what's going on with my computer. Normally I type in python -- version to begin so that my program knows that i'm using python, yet I'm not always successful.
So I'm waiting for our next class to get help with the import requests. In the meantine I'm going to keep praticing my simple python programs until I can start building them up more. I don't currently have a  real problem that i'm solving with these programs but eventually I'm going to challenge myself to answer a real problem with my python skills.
